        <p class="d-inline-flex p-2 bd-highlight h4">
            Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the
            external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.
        </p>

            It's also known as female circumcision or cutting, and by other terms, such as sunna, gudniin, halalays,
            tahur, megrez and khitan, among others.

                <h2 class="text-center">How many women and girls are affected?</h2>
            </font>
        </p>
        <p>An estimated 200 million girls and women alive today are believed to have been subjected to FGM; but rates of
            FGM are increasing, a reflection of global population growth. Girls and women who have undergone FGM live
            predominately in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab States, but FGM is also practiced in select countries in
            Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. It is also practiced among migrant populations throughout Europe,
            North America, Australia and New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p>If FGM practices continue at recent levels, 68 million girls will be cut between 2015 and 2030 in 25
            countries where FGM is routinely practiced and more recent data are available.
        </p>
        <p>A key challenge is not only protecting girls who are currently at risk but also ensuring that those to be
            born in the future will be free from the dangers of the practice. This is especially important considering
            that FGM-concentrated countries are generally experiencing high population growth and have large youth
            populations. In 2019, an estimated 4.1 million girls will be cut. This number of girls cut each year is
            projected to rise to 4.6 million girls in the year 2030.

                <li>The practice has no health benefits for girls and women.</li>
                <li>FGM can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, as well as
                    complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths.</li>
                <li>More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been cut in 30 countries in Africa, the
                    Middle
                    East and Asia where FGM is concentrated (1).</li>
                <li>FGM is mostly carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15.</li>
                <li>FGM is a violation of the human rights of girls and women.</li>
                <li>WHO is opposed to all forms of FGM, and is opposed to health care providers performing FGM
                    (medicalization of FGM).</li>
                <li>Treatment of health complications of FGM in 27 high prevalence countries costs 1.4 billion USD per
                    year.

                <h2 class="text-center">Why FGM is carried out</h2>
            </font>
        </p>
        <p>FGM is carried out for various cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities in the
            mistaken belief that it'll benefit the girl in some way (for example, as a preparation for marriage or to
            preserve her virginity).</p>
        <p>But there are no acceptable reasons that justify FGM. It's a harmful practice that has no health benefits.
        </p>
        <p>FGM usually happens to girls whose mothers, grandmothers or extended female family members have had FGM
            themselves, or if their father comes from a community where it's&nbsp;carried&nbsp;out.
        </p>

            </font>
        </p>

        <p>Girls are sometimes taken abroad for FGM, but they may not be aware this is the reason for their travel.
        </p>
        <p>Girls are more at risk of FGM being carried out during the summer holidays, as this allows more time for
            them to "heal" before they return to school.</p>
        <p>If you think there's a risk of this happening to you,&nbsp;you can <a

                the Statement Opposing FGM</a> and take it with you on holiday to show your family.</p>
        <p>Communities that perform FGM are found in many parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia.</p>
        <p>Girls who were born in the UK or are resident here but whose families originate from an FGM-practising
            community are at greater risk of FGM happening to them.</p>
